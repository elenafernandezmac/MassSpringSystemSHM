# MassSpringSystemSHM
This program allows the user to analyse a mass' simple harmonic movement when attached to a spring (mass-spring-system). Being able to easily vizualize the values plotted.

To run the program, download this repository, open it in visual studio code, press Ctrl+Ñ in order to open the console, write python m and press Tab button. 
At this point you only need to insert the values you need to and the charts will automatically open in a new tab.

This program uses the following fromulas
Spring Force/Hooke's Law=-kx (N/m)
Elastic potential energy= 0.5kx^2
Kinetic energy= 0.5mv^2
Angular frequency ω=(k/m)**0.5
Position(t)=Acos(ωt)
Velocity(t)=−Aωsin(ωt)
Angular acceleration(t)= −Aω^2 cos(ωt)
